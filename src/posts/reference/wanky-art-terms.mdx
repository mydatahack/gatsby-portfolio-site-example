## Sentences

## Made up

- I find the work unequivocally compelling because it contrasexualise the disjunctive purterbation of the quantitative phantasma in a deceptively sloquent manner, which superimposes the textual uality of the lost dialogue that juxtaposes the serendipity of the movement itself with the deviously simple complexity of the human emotions, hinting the existance of spacial and temporal relationships between the urban environment and homo sapience.

- Your work has to participate in the socio-political discourse.

- Be wary of anyone who denies art its true complex and eternal nature, repurposing it for their own political contrivances.
